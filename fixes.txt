# Improvements for mnop-app

Users are being charged too much for direct sell products. I tried to purchase an item for $5 and $10 shipping but ended up being charged $15.75 (virtual currency)

Break the profile up into smaller components to improve loading times

Add earnings summary to the /earnings page

Remove duplicate styles

{Order cancelation isn't working:

    at RefundService.processRefund (refundService.js:408:48)
    at async handleCancelOrder (OrdersPage.jsx:96:34)
}

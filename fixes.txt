Fix loading spinner: remove text, fix aspect ratio to 1:1, make sure that each component can only load one instance of the loading spinner at a time. Because at the momment there are multiple loading spinners overlapping on a single component or page. 
Refresh notifications once when the site loads for the first time.
Designers should be able to set a custom shipping cost and set up their own delivery service. This should include an option to provide free shipping for specific products or orders over a set price.
Add option to omit "state" for some countries
The commission rate is not working properly for the business account. The rate is set to 2% at the moment but I was getting 1%. Also, not all the transactions are showing. It seems like only unique orders are showing in recent transactions.
All user roles need to show on the wallet page. The roles still aren't showing, it's only showing one role.
Customers should be able to cancel orders for a brief window of 1 hour. Customer orders sent to the designer should show whether the products have passed this period or not.
Designers should be able to see refund requests on the customer orders tab and either grant refund or deny refund
Always show an "add to cart" button on the product detail page for every user.
Admin needs to see all refundable orders of all time and search through them.
Designers need to be notified about changes to the commission rate
All users need to be notified about changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy and content policy
Add change detection to inputs using local storage to prevent unnecessary writes to the database
Customers can't see order details: "Page Not Found The page you are looking for doesn't exist or has been moved." orders/GpjrMadUmKE8JsIGB0Rr
Add tax calculations based on the country and territory of the user
Add a system to create composite products which are made up of 2 or more other products. The system will need to account for inventory levels.

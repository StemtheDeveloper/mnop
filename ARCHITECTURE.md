# M'NOP Platform Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the M'NOP platform architecture, designed to help developers understand how the various components interact and function together.

## System Overview

M'NOP is built on a modern front-end architecture with Firebase as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS). The application follows a component-based design approach with React and leverages Firebase services for authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions.

## Core Architectural Components

### Frontend (React)

#### Component Layer

The user interface is built with React components, organized by feature and functionality. Components are primarily functional, utilizing hooks for state management and side effects.

Key component directories:

- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/pages`: Full page components representing different views

#### Context Layer

React Context API is used for state management, avoiding prop drilling and centralizing state logic.

Key contexts:

- `UserContext`: Manages authentication state and user profile data
- `ToastContext`: Handles application notifications and alerts
- `CartContext`: Manages shopping cart state
- `NotificationContext`: Manages user notifications

#### Service Layer

Services encapsulate all interactions with Firebase and external APIs, providing a clean interface for the components.

Key services:

- `authService`: Authentication operations
- `firestoreService`: Database operations
- `storageService`: File storage operations
- `twoFactorAuthService`: MFA implementation

#### Hooks Layer

Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic and state management.

Key hooks:

- `useUser`: Access user context
- `useProducts`: Product-related operations
- `useInvestments`: Investment-related operations
- `useNotifications`: Notification management

### Backend (Firebase)

#### Authentication

Firebase Authentication handles user identity management, including:

- Email/password authentication
- Social media sign-in (Google, Facebook, Twitter)
- Multi-factor authentication (phone)
- Role-based access control

#### Firestore Database

Cloud Firestore provides a NoSQL document database with collections for:

- `users`: User profiles and settings
- `products`: Product listings and details
- `investments`: Investment records and transactions
- `orders`: Purchase orders and fulfillment status
- `transactions`: Financial transaction records
- `achievements`: User achievement definitions
- `notifications`: User notification records
- `conversations`: User-to-user messaging

#### Cloud Storage

Firebase Storage is used for:

- User profile images
- Product images and attachments
- Design files and documentation

#### Cloud Functions

Serverless functions implement backend logic:

- `processInvestment`: Handle investment transactions
- `dailyInterestCalculation`: Calculate interest for investments
- `distributeRevenue`: Distribute product revenue to stakeholders
- `updateExchangeRates`: Update currency exchange rates
- `checkProductDeadlines`: Monitor product milestones and deadlines
- `stockNotifications`: Send notifications for inventory changes
- `updateMarketRates`: Update market trend information
- `trendingProductExtension`: Update trending product algorithms

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials or uses social login
2. Firebase Auth validates credentials
3. If MFA is enabled, user is prompted for verification code
4. Upon successful authentication, UserContext is updated
5. User is redirected to appropriate page based on roles

### Product Creation Flow

1. Designer creates new product concept
2. Product data is saved to Firestore
3. Designer uploads images to Storage
4. Product becomes available for manufacturer selection
5. Notifications are sent to potential manufacturers
6. Investment opportunities are created

### Investment Flow

1. Investor selects product to invest in
2. Investment amount is validated against wallet balance
3. `processInvestment` Cloud Function handles transaction
4. Product funding progress is updated
5. Interest calculations are scheduled
6. Both investor and product owner receive notifications

### Purchase Flow

1. Customer adds product to cart
2. Customer proceeds to checkout
3. Order is created in Firestore
4. Payment is processed
5. Order status is updated
6. `distributeRevenue` function allocates revenue to stakeholders

## Security Model

### Authentication Security

- Firebase Authentication handles credential validation
- Two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer
- Session management with proper token handling
- Password policies and account recovery procedures

### Data Security

- Firestore security rules enforce access control
- Role-based permissions for database operations
- Data validation at both client and server levels
- Secure API calls with proper authentication

### Encryption

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Secure storage of sensitive user information
- Encrypted wallet transactions

## Scalability Considerations

### Frontend Scalability

- Code splitting for better loading performance
- Lazy loading of components and routes
- Optimized React rendering with proper key usage
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders

### Backend Scalability

- Firebase's automatic scaling for database and storage
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Efficient Cloud Functions with appropriate timeout settings
- Batch operations for bulk updates

## Deployment Architecture

The M'NOP platform follows a continuous deployment model:

1. Code is pushed to GitHub repository
2. CI/CD pipeline runs tests and builds the application
3. Production build is deployed to Firebase Hosting
4. Cloud Functions are deployed to Firebase Functions
5. Database schema updates are applied if needed

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Firebase Analytics tracks user behavior
- Performance monitoring for frontend and backend
- Error tracking and reporting
- User engagement metrics

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Microservices architecture for specific functions
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Advanced caching strategies
- WebSocket implementation for real-time features

This architecture document will be updated as the system evolves and new components are added.

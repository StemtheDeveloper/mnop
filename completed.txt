# Completed Improvements

- Create granular logging system for audit trails
- Fix loading spinner: remove text, fix aspect ratio to 1:1, make sure that each component can only load one instance of the loading spinner at a time. Because at the moment there are multiple loading spinners overlapping on a single component or page.
- Add option to omit "state" for some countries
- Designers should be able to see refund requests on the customer orders tab and either grant refund or deny refund
- Always show an "add to cart" button on the product detail page for every user
- Admin needs to see all refundable orders of all time and search through them
- Add terms and conditions, privacy policy and content policy pages. All users need to be notified about changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy and content policy.
- Add change detection to inputs using local storage to prevent unnecessary writes to the database
- Customers can't see order details: "Page Not Found The page you are looking for doesn't exist or has been moved." orders/GpjrMadUmKE8JsIGB0Rr
- Add tax calculations based on the country and territory of the user
- Add a system to create composite products which are made up of 2 or more other products. The system will need to account for inventory levels.
- Create advanced filtering system for product search with multiple parameters
- Add batch operations in admin DataFixerTool for multiple collection types
- Add two-factor authentication for admin and designer accounts
- Non admin users should not be able to change their role
- Add a button on the product page for users who don't have the "investor" role. It should "Register as an investor" and will lead to a page for users to add information to become an investor.

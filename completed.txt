# Completed Improvements

- Fix loading spinner: remove text, fix aspect ratio to 1:1, make sure that each component can only load one instance of the loading spinner at a time. Because at the momment there are multiple loading spinners overlapping on a single component or page.
- Add option to omit "state" for some countries
- Designers should be able to see refund requests on the customer orders tab and either grant refund or deny refund
- Always show an "add to cart" button on the product detail page for every user
- Admin needs to see all refundable orders of all time and search through them

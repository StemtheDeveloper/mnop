# Completed Improvements

- Fix loading spinner: remove text, fix aspect ratio to 1:1, make sure that each component can only load one instance of the loading spinner at a time. Because at the moment there are multiple loading spinners overlapping on a single component or page.
- Add option to omit "state" for some countries
- Designers should be able to see refund requests on the customer orders tab and either grant refund or deny refund
- Always show an "add to cart" button on the product detail page for every user
- Admin needs to see all refundable orders of all time and search through them
- Add terms and conditions, privacy policy and content policy pages. All users need to be notified about changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy and content policy.
- Add change detection to inputs using local storage to prevent unnecessary writes to the database
- Customers can't see order details: "Page Not Found The page you are looking for doesn't exist or has been moved." orders/GpjrMadUmKE8JsIGB0Rr
- Add tax calculations based on the country and territory of the user

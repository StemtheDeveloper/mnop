- Always show an "add to cart" button on the product detail page for every user

- Create advanced filtering system for product search with multiple parameters
- Add batch operations in admin DataFixerTool for multiple collection types
- Add two-factor authentication for admin and designer accounts
- Non admin users should not be able to change their role

- Update all button styling to fit the color scheme and pill shape. (see footer)
- Update all styling to display elements consistently for all users and roles.
- Fix message link on userprofile. This results in a 404 error: http://localhost:5173/messages/new/uwSZRw7q3jf9YyiegJWZdo8WHq53. Need to either link to an existing conversation or create a new one
- Scroll down to the bottom of messages-container when a message is sent or the conversation loads. Prevent this from bubbling up to the rest of the page.
- Create a notification to let designers know when their products have been fully funded. Also similar notifications for investors and manufacturers.
- Replace alert confirmation message with a custom one (when transferring funding to manufacturer)
- Create a system for users to review each other from the UserProfilePage, also show details like orders fulfilled, products manufactured and anything else that might help users vet each other.
- Create a system for designers to optionally select a manufacturer before a product is fully funded. They should still be able to change this in their manufacturer settings on their profile. And I would like to give designers the option to automatically send the funds for a product when it is fully funded.
- Don't show product's stock quantity until it is fully funded. Also, do not show "add to cart" button unless the product is fully funded.
